1. Importing Required Libraries
•	Import libraries such as yfinance, pandas, os, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and sklearn.
•	yfinance: For fetching stock data from Yahoo Finance API.
•	pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
•	os: For interacting with the operating system to handle file operations.
•	matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn: For data visualization.
•	sklearn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
2. Data Collection
•	Fetch data from Yahoo Finance API using yfinance library.
•	Check if a CSV file containing NVDA stock data exists.
•	If the CSV file doesn't exist, fetch data from the API and save it as a CSV file for future use.
•	Ensure data is collected for analysis and modeling purposes.
3. Data Preprocessing
•	Check for null values in the dataset.
•	Examine the shape of the dataset to understand its dimensions.
•	Generate descriptive statistics to gain insights into data distribution and central tendency.
•	Handle missing values if necessary using techniques like imputation or deletion.
•	Convert data types if needed to ensure compatibility with analysis and modeling tasks.
Checking for Null Values
•	Use .isnull().sum() to count missing values in each column.
•	Handle missing values by imputation or deletion based on data characteristics.
Checking Dataset Shape
•	Use .shape attribute to get the number of rows and columns in the dataset.
Descriptive Statistics
•	Use .describe() method to obtain summary statistics like mean, median, min, max, and quartiles.
4. Feature Engineering
•	Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
•	Consider domain knowledge and feature importance to guide feature engineering efforts.
•	Explore techniques such as one-hot encoding, feature scaling, and polynomial features.
•	Validate feature engineering choices through iterative experimentation and evaluation.
Creating Target Variable "Tomorrow"
•	Shift the "Close" data by one day to create the target variable for predicting future stock prices.
•	Ensure alignment of features and target variable for accurate model training.
5. Data Visualization
•	Use data visualization techniques to explore patterns and relationships in the data.
•	Plot time series data to visualize trends and seasonality.
•	Create histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to understand feature distributions and correlations.
•	Customize plots with labels, titles, and color palettes for effective communication.
•	Use interactive visualization tools if needed to enhance data exploration.
Plotting NVDA Stock Closing Price Over Time
•	Use matplotlib.pyplot to plot the closing price of NVDA stock over time.
•	Visualize trends, anomalies, and patterns in the stock price data.






 
6. Feature Selection
•	Identify relevant features that contribute most to the predictive task.
•	Use domain knowledge, feature importance techniques, and model-based selection methods.
•	Consider trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability when selecting features.
•	Perform feature selection iteratively to refine the model and improve performance.
7. Model Building
•	Build machine learning models to make predictions based on the selected features.
•	Select appropriate algorithms based on the nature of the problem (e.g., classification, regression).
•	Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
•	Train the models on the training data and evaluate their performance using evaluation metrics.
•	Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search for improved model performance.
Splitting the Data
•	Use train_test_split to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
•	Allocate a certain percentage of data for training and the remaining for testing.
Random Forest Classifier
•	Train a Random Forest Classifier model using the RandomForestClassifier class from sklearn.ensemble.
•	Random Forest is chosen for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and capture complex relationships.





Model Evaluation
•	Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy.
•	Use cross-validation to assess model generalization and mitigate overfitting.
Accuracy Calculation
•	Calculate accuracy using the accuracy_score function from sklearn.metrics.


 





8. Plotting Actual vs Predicted
•	Visualize the model's predictions against the actual values to assess its performance.
•	Plot the predicted values against the true values to identify discrepancies and patterns.
•	Use line plots, scatter plots, or other suitable visualization techniques for comparison.


9. Plotting Confusion Matrix
•	Construct a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of a classification model.
•	Visualize true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
•	Use heatmap visualization to highlight areas of high and low performance.




10. Plotting Feature Importance
•	Determine the importance of features in predicting the target variable.
•	Use techniques such as Gini importance or permutation importance to quantify feature importance.
•	Plot feature importance scores to identify the most influential features in the model's predictions.
•	Interpret feature importance plots to gain insights into the underlying data patterns.
11. AdaBoost Classifier
•	Explore AdaBoost Classifier, a boosting ensemble method that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong classifier.
•	Perform hyperparameter tuning using grid search to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters.
•	Evaluate the best model's performance using accuracy or other relevant evaluation metrics.
•	Compare the performance of AdaBoost Classifier with other models to determine its effectiveness in the given task.
